# ML_Supervised_Learning

Welcome to my project for Intro to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning.
I have created the dataset used in this project using data about my golf swing. Using A GCQuad golf launch monitor I have gathered data from hundreds of golf shots between 9 different clubs.

My main goal of this project is to train models to categorize my golf shots into 1 of 4 categories. Great, Good, OK, and Bad. Using several features from our golf dataset I will work out how to cateforize each shot. With features like Offline, Carry Distance, Spin, and more, we will determine how the shots fall into each category. Using this knowledge we will then train two models, Decision Tree and Random Forest and hopefully get good results even if it takes some tweaking within the models.
